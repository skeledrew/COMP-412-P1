# COMP 412 - Assignment #1

## Introduction

hellw.py is a basic "Hello World" program written in Python 3. 
The Python 3 interpreter implements the latest version of the language.

## Installation

To find and install the interpreter for your particular system,
please check <https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html>.
Be sure to select Python 3 instead of Python 2 wherever the
option is given.

## Usage
hellw.py is a command-line script, and so is best when run from a
terminal (Command Prompt on Windows). First you will need to save
hellw.py to a folder on your computer. Open a prompt and navigate
to the folder you saved to and execute with "python3 hellw.py".

Alternatively, if .py files are associated with a Python
interpreter, you can double-click the script to run it.


GOOD LUCK!
